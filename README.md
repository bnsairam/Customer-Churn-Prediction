# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn (stop using a service) using machine learning. It employs a Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn to model churn based on features like age, tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and support calls. The project includes visualizations using seaborn to show churn probability distribution and feature importance. A bonus section provides code to load data from a CSV or mock API endpoint.

## Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- requests (for API integration, optional)

## Features
- Predicts customer churn using a Random Forest model.
- Visualizes churn probability distribution with a histogram.
- Displays feature importance to identify key predictors of churn.
- Supports loading real-world data from a CSV or API.
